* Lambda Days 2016
** Day 1
*** Propositions as Types - Philip Wadler

    - Hilarious subject of computability theory:
      - Main actors: Hilbert, Church, Turing, Godel.
      - Problem: David Hilbert "Entscheidungsproblem" (1932)
      - Contra 1: Kurt Godel, "This statement is not provable" (1935)
      - Contra 2: Alonzo Church, "Lambda Calculus" (1936)
        - Introduces three concepts: variables, abstraction, application.
      - Contra 3: Alan Turing, "Turing Machine" (1936)
        - Math is discovered - 3 independent papers about the same result
    - Propositions as Types:
      - Gentzen (1935) - Natural Deduction
        - It is a *modus ponens*.
      - Very intuitive syntax for constructive logic proofs.
        - Invented for showing consistency and formalization of proofs in
          constructive logic.
      - "Typed lambda-calculus" (1940, Church)
        - Macro-language for constructive logic. Unfortunately untyped version
          has no guarantees about termination, so you can do roundabout proofs
          and prove false.
          - Turing shown that programs written in typed lambda calculus are
            terminating.
      - Curry-Howard isomorphism (correspondence) - in simple words
        "constructive logic proofs are equal to the typed lambda calculus".
        - Haskell Curry wrote that for a different branch of logic, Howard
          translated to typed lambda calculus.
          - Propositions === Types
          - Proofs === Programs
          - Normalisation of proofs === Evaluation of programs
        - It is not a coincidence - similar correspondence:
          - ML Type System <-> Type Schemes,
          - Hindley-Milner Type System,
          - Linear Logic <-> Session Types
          - Classical-Intuitionistic Embedding <-> CPS
        - Every interesting logic has corresponding "programming language
          feature".
          - It is so powerful that even Rusell's paradox (you cannot prove a
            false thing) corresponds to the particular feature in programming
            language (recursion, non-termination and ability to write any, even
            not provable programs).
          - Session types, linear logic and 20 years of discovering
            correspondence between logic and language feature (send / receive,
            read / write).
      - Is *actor model* invented or discovered?
        - Philip Wadler think that it is invented.
      - Languages like Python, Java, C# are "invented".
        - Haskell, Scheme, Lisp etc. are "discovered".
      - Tools with dependent types and proofs:
        - Coq
        - Agda
      - Paper:
        - Philip Wadler, "Propositions as Types"
          - Communications of ACM, 12.2015
      - Q: Lambda calculus as a universal programming language?
        - A: "No, it is too limiting".
      - Q: What about having machine with different architecture than von Neumann for that?
        - A: A lot of work done in that matter.

*** Phoenix a web framework for the new web - José Valim

    - Typical presentation about Phoenix and Elixir.
      - Nice benchmarks, unfortunately no word about infrastructure, machine
        size and so on.
    - In Phoenix you don't have to choose productivity over performance, you can
      be productive, in short and long term and also have good vertical and
      horizontal scalability characteristics.
    - Two key concepts:
      - Phoenix Channels - an abstraction over transport protocol, assuming
        nothing about clients, providing certain protocol for them. It can be
        based on top of WebSocket, TCP, CoAP, MQTT and so on.
      - Applications - help in terms of maintenance, introspection and
        standardization of concepts, guides and so on.

*** The Mysteries of Dropbox - John Hughes

    - Similar approach to the Jepsen tool by @aphyr.
    - Published also as a paper "Mysteries of Dropbox".
    - They have prepared QuickCheck model which tests file synchronization
      logic.
      - Just a one file, multiple clients, reading and writing content.
      - First - you have to debug your model.
    - Standard introduction to the QuickCheck (example with queue implemented in
      C).
    - Synchronization is a hard problem.
      - Timing (completely omitted in the model, assumptions about time and
        assumptions about shrinking).
      - Network - flawless network without any faults, build on top of multiple
        virtual machines on a single laptop, all in the same network.
      - State stabilization is hard in this case - you have to wait for all
        clients, server to be idle and you can't wait too long.
    - In server logic you have to build buffering, conflicts resolution,
      specific business use cases and edge cases.
    - On the meta-level it treats system of DropBox clients and server as a
      black-box, it prepares state transitions and reports observations, than
      assuming certain flow and logic it eliminates a lot of not valid paths in
      a tree, as in the case of Jepsen and database linearizability tests.

*** Testing scalability of Erlang OpenFlow controller - Szymon Mentel

    - SDN - Software Defined Networking, decoupling data plane from control
      plane. Applications can control network.
      - Data plane sends messages to controller, which decides about routing,
        rules, filtering etc.
    - Erlang - distributed system test setup and controller plane
      implementation.
    - OpenFlow is a protocol, an API and application (configuration) layer for
      SDN and programmable switches.

*** Using an actor framework for scientific computing: opportunities and challenges - Krzysztof Borowski

    - Actor model used as a representation of workflows, used in various cases
      e.g. scientific computing.
      - Example - Scalaflow (Scala, Akka, Cassandra).
      - Akka Streams, Akka Persistence - everything for modeling workflow.

*** Teaching functional programming to n00bs in mobs - Rob Martin
*** Elixir and Elm - the perfect couple - Tomasz Kowal
*** Embracing change - how to introduce Clojure into your company technology stack seamlessly - Artur Skowroński
